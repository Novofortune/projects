<description><![CDATA[If you're a die-hard fan of TV renovation programs and have longed for the chance to transform a jaded Canberra home for profit, then this may be the one! Highly regarded as one of the best real estate tactics.....buying a home in need of some inspiration and vision is a smart choice for investors and home owners alike.

Sited on a huge 1137m2 block, with an impressive $302,000 UV, this spacious four bedroom home with study/formal dining and ensuite is the perfect reason to start an account at your local hardware store and an ideal shell to mould into something astonishing.

 

The original home is set to one side of the block, making it a great opportunity to develop an extension or dual occupancy (subject to approval) for maximum gain on your investment or even add outdoor features and entertainment options that will be the envy of the neighbourhood.

The current owners have used as a five bedroom home and as such it's already a potential money-spinner with an anticipated rental return of $500-$550 per week once it's been transformed.

If you're not afraid of rolling up your sleeves, or have a few good tradies in your contacts list, then this is the perfect chance to buy a large house on a huge block and create a dream home that would normally be out of your budget.

 

Be creative! Gather some friends together and challenge them to create the best design or share the whole project with like-minded investors who will pitch in for the experience as well as the potential gain. 

Set in a loop street, it's a location that's bound to match whatever inspiration you can add to the property. There's a children's park just a few houses down and it's only a stroll from several local shops or Mount Rogers Reserve.

Features:
Large block - 1137m2
Four bedrooms plus study/formal dining

Offered with vacant possession ready to renovate
 Kitchen and family room opening to backyard
 Generous living room with large windows
 Ensuite with shower, vanity and wc
 Main bathroom with bathtub & shower
 Spacious laundry
 Huge back yard with loads of potential
 Double garage and carport
 Large garden shed

Living Area: 145m2 approximate

Garage: 43m2 approximate

Carport: 37m2 approximate

PLEASE NOTE:  PROPERTY SOLD AS IS, NO FURTHER WORK OR MAINTENANCE WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON PROPERTY, INCLUSIONS OR APPLIANCES.

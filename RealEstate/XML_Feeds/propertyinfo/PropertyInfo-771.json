Equally attractive to a wide range of ages from young couples to older professionals, and even empty-nesters wanting to downsize, it's just as appealing on the inside too with a floor plan offering a spacious lounge room, a kitchen with ample storage\/preparation space plus a bathroom, separate laundry and bedroom.\n\nTogether with its own private courtyard, a driveway and car shelter, it's a property that provides a great sense of sanctuary when you're at home, yet remains within easy reach of everything the area has to offer. Local shops are walking distance away - the morning commute to the University of Canberra, Belconnen Town Centre and AIS will only take minutes - and public transport gives you access the city, Woden or Gungahlin\n\nRent per week is $300 - $320"}],"property_pricings":[{"property_pricing_id":5841,"property_id":771,"sale_method":"FR","sale_price":"280"}],"property_details":[{"property_detail_id":5841,"property_id":771,"type":"2","num_bedroom":"1","num_bathroom":"1","num_parking":"0","energy_rating":"0.0"}],"property_imgs":[{"property_img_id":85923,"property_id":771,"url":"http:\/\/img.agentaccount.com\/ec2906a0bfb55b477837191124df1864730b93be"},{"property_img_id":85924,"property_id":771,"url":"http:\/\/img.agentaccount.com\/335644ff25cdc338e207bd8f01241d5c3a8c7042"},{"property_img_id":85925,"property_id":771,"url":"http:\/\/img.agentaccount.com\/d3908e1a54e685fb17e160b8c183f631ce3a04db"},{"property_img_id":85926,"property_id":771,"url":"http:\/\/img.agentaccount.com\/70ab881715b118d4d075336846f5af016155080e"}],"inspection_dates":[],"listing_agents":[{"listing_agent_id":11281,"property_id":771,"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"Fromholtz","telephone":"","email":"pm@rutherfordjohnston.com"},{"listing_agent_id":11282,"property_id":771,"first_name":null,"last_name":null,"telephone":null,"email":null}]},"mod_time":"2015-05-26 14:54:04","translation_status":false}
